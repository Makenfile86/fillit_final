This is a 42 School project.

The task was to create a program that stacks tetris pieces in a way that takes the least amount of space in a "map".
The map is a square and the piece is in a 4x4 square in the form of a standard tetris piece. You also have to respect the order of the tetris pieces,
if you can manage the same smallest square in a multible ways you have to fill it where the earlier pieces are put in first. 
You also have to start from the left corner.

Example of the pieces you have to manage in a format that the program reads them:

As you can see the first piece was labeled with the letter A and second piece with a letter B and so on.
