This is a 42 School project.

The task was to create a program that stacks tetris pieces in a way that takes the least amount of space in a "map".
The map is a square and the piece is in a 4x4 square in the form of a standard tetris piece. You also have to respect the order of the tetris pieces,
if you can manage the same smallest square in a multible ways you have to fill it where the earlier pieces are put in first. 
You also have to start from the left corner.



Example of testfile (in a correct form) you have to manage:                                                                                          

![pieces:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/fillit_final/blob/master/pieces3.png?raw=true)

And with ./fillit testfile command you get:

![Results:](https://github.com/Makenfile86/fillit_final/blob/master/result.jpg?raw=true)

As you can see the first piece was labeled with the letter A and second piece with a letter B and so on.
